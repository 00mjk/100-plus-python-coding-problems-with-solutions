### S-4: Explanation
Just take a number from the user. Allow the user to enter a float number. Then, multiply that number by 1.609344. Keep the multiplication in the kilometers variable. 

The kilometers is your answer. 

Oh, wait...you are not done yet!

Now, tell me, if you have to do this using a function, how will you do that?

Go to the code editor and then try it yourself. When you do it yourself without following instructions, you will understand it. You will be able to feel the code and that is a big step in becoming a programmer!
