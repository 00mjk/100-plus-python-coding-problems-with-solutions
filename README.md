## 0: Introduction

### S-1: Welcome
Welcome to the problem-solving galaxy. 

#### S-2: Problem Solving
In this galaxy, we will focus on real-world coding related problem-solving. 

The problem-solving means, we will take a small programming problem. We will think about the process of solving the problem and then we will solve it. 


#### S-3: Explanation
After the solution, we will explain the answer. Convey the concept and strategy to solve it. 

#### S-4: Purpose
Solving coding problems helps you to think about the problem. It will make you a better developer. Moreover, if you want to participate in a programming contest, you need to practice problem-solving. 

#### S-5: Interview
Besides, large companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber, etc. ask a lot of problem-solving related questions in their job interview.<br><br>If you want to work any of these large companies, you should practice problem-solving.


#### S-6: Many solutions
Here we are focusing on the thinking and strategies to solve a problem. However, every problem could be solved in multiple ways. And other solutions could be better and faster. 

Always keep an open mind to learn multiple solutions to solve a problem.

#### S-7: Let’s Start
> Let’s start your journey. Let’s solve every problem you face. 

*Let’s do it.*
